# Chapter 14

## Tight Coupling
Tight Coupling - one instance (Front End) talking to another instance (Back End)

## Loose Coupling
Loose Coupling - ELB -> multiple instances (Front End) talking to ELB -> multiple instances (Back End)

## 3 Upcoming Services
Simple Queue Service (SQS) - fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems and serverless applications
Simple Notification Service (SNS) - fully managed server for both app-to-app and app-to-person communication
API gateway - fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale

## SQS
Poll-based messaging - automatic process to receive message from a queue

SQS - messaging queue that allows asynchronous processing of work 

SQS settings:
- delivery delay
- message size
- encryption 
- message retention
- long vs short (always think of Long)
- queue depth

visibility timeout - message is lock for 30 seconds where no one can see it in SQS

Dead-letter - another SQS can temp side-line message. Note: need to make dead letter queue first in order to describe to another queue


## Standard Queue
- best effort ordering
- duplication message
- nearly unlimited transactions per second

## FIFO 
- guranteed ordering 
- no message dup
- 300 messages per second
- cost more


## Deliver Message with SNS
Push-Based Messaging - the opposite of polled based messaging
SNS - is a push based messaging service

SNS settings:
- subscribers
- message size (256kb)
- dead-letter queue (DLQ) support
- FIFO or standard SNS: FIFO only supports SQS as a subscriber
- Encryption
- Access Policy

## Fronting App with API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway - fully management service that allows you to easily publish, create, maintain and secure your API

- Security: WAF 
- Stop Abuse: rate limiting
- Ease of use
