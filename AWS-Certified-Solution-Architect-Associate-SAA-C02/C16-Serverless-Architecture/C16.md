# Chapter 16

## Lambda
Lambda - a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing the underlyting servers

Building a Function:
- Runtime (Python, Java....)
- Permission (need to attach to a role)
- Network (VPC, subnet, SG)
- Resources (CPU, RAM)
- Trigger (alert to your Lambda to start)

Lambda limitations: 10GB of RAM and 15 minutes of run

## Container
Container - standard unit of software that packages up and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

Dockerfile - text docs contains all the commands to build an image

## Running Containers in ECS or EKS

ECS - elastic container service:
- management of contaienrs at scale
- ELB integration
- Role Integration
- Ease of use

EKS - elastic kubernetes service

## Removing Server with Fargate
Fargate - serverless compute engine for containers that works with both ECS and EKS. Isolate environments, No OS access, pay based on resources allocated and time ran, short-running tasks

Fargate when you have more consistent workloads. Allows Docker use across the organization and a greater level of control by developers. No time limits


## EventBridge (CW Events)

EventBridge - CW 2.0 - serverless event bus. It allows you to pass events from a source to endpoint. 

Create a rule:
- Define pattern
- Select Event Bus
- Select Target
- Tag

Event Bridge - API call to trigger lambda functions when an AWS API call happens

Any AWS API call can be a trigger to kick off event bridge rule
