What is IAM?
I am allows you to manage users and level of access to the AWS Console

IAM root account - email address use to sign up for AWS. Full Admin access to AWS. 

### Control users with IAM
Permissions using policy documents (JSON) \
IAM Policy Documents can be assign to groups, users, roles 

The Principle of Least Privilage - Only assign a user the minimum amount of privilages they need to do their job.

New user - by default Users does not have any permission or policy

IAM is universal - does not apply to regions at this time

Access Key ID and secret access keys are not the same as username and passwords

IAM Federation - you can combine your existing user account with AWS. For ie: you use the same credentials in Active Directory to login to AWS 

Identity Federation - uses the SAML standard (Active Directory)
