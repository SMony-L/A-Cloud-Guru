## Elastic Block Store (EBS)

EBS Volumes: (Virtual Hard Disk in Cloud) storage volumes you can attach to your EC2 instances

EBS mission criticle: 
- production workloads
- highly available
- scalability

General Purpose SSD (gp2): 3 IOPS per GB, max 16,000 IOPS/volume, volumes smaller than 1TB can burst up to 3,000 IOPS, good for test, development or boot volumes
General Purpose SSD (gp3): 3,000 IOPS baseline performance and 125 MiB/s, high performance at low cost (MySQL, Cassandra, virtual desktops), 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s, 4x faster than gp2

Provision IOPS SSD (io1): high performance, most expensive, 64,000 IOPS/volume, 50 IOPS per GB
Provision IOPS SSD (io2): later generation, higher durability and more IOPS, 500 OPS per GB up to 64,000 IOPS/volume

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): low cost hard drive drive, throughput 40 MB/s per TB, burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, max 500 MB/s per volume, frequently accessed, big data, data warehouse, and log processing, cannot be a boot volume

Cold HDD (sc1): lowest cost option, 12 MB/s per TB, burst up to 80 MB/s per TB, max 250 MB/s per volume, good for cold data requiring fewer scan per day, good for file server, static images 


IOPS - measure the number of read and write operations per second, metric for quick transactions, low-latency apps, transaction workloads

Throughput - measure number of bits read or written per second (MB/s), metric for large dataset, large I/O sizes, complex queries


## Volumes and Snapshot

Volumes are virutal hard disk. 1 per EC2 instance. Root device volume

Snapshots exists on S3, a photo of the virtual disk/volume, point in time copy of a volume, incremental, first snapshot will take longer
- Consistent Snapshots
- Encrypted Snapshots
- Shared Snapshots

EBS Volumes will be in the same AZ as EC2, Resizing on the fly, Change volume type on the fly

EBS Encryption - with data key AES-256. Use AWS Key Mgmt Server (KMS), Customer Master Key (CMK) when creating Snapshots and volumes. Data at rest is encrypted, Volumes + Snapshots are encrypted. Copying unencrypted snapshots allows encryption, snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted, you can encrypt root device when created

EC2 Hibernation - perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk), saves the contents from RAM to EBS root volume. instance boots much faster, RAM must be less than 150 GB, cannot hibernate longer than 60 days

## Elastic File System (EFS)

EFS - managed NFS (Network file system) that can be mounted to many EC2 instances. Works with EC2 in multi-AZ. High availability, scalable but expensive. 

Use case: content-management system, web servers farm.

Use NFSv4 protocol, Linux based AMI, Encryption at rest using KMS, File system scale automatically

Performance: supports thousands of concurrent connections (EC2 instances). 10 GBs throughput. Scale to Petabytes

Controlling Performance: General Purposes (web server), Max I/O (Big data)

Storage Tiers and Life Cycle Mgmt
- Standard Storage Tier
- Infrequently Accessed 

## FSx

FSx for Windows - Windows File Server which fully managed Microsoft. Runs Windows Server Message Block (SMB)

FSx for Luster - fully managed file system that is optimized for compute-intensive workloads (machine learning, AI, ...)


Different scenarios 
EFS: need distributed, highly resilient storage for Linux instances
Amazon FSx for Windows: centralized storage for Windows based applications (MySQL, Workspaces, ...)
FSx for Luster: high speed, high capacity distributed storage (Financial modeling, ...). It can store data direclty on S3

## Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
AMI: provides info to launch an instance

5 things you can based AMI on: Region, OS, Architecture (32-bit or 64 bit), Launch permissions, Storage for root device

AMI backed by Amazon EBS: volume created from EBS snapshot. Can be stopped. You will not lose data if the instance stopped. Root device volume will be deleted on termination but you can tell AWS to keep the root device.

AMI backed by Instance store (ephemeral storage): volume created from template stored in S3. It cannot be stopped. If host failed, you will lose data. If delete instance, you will lose the volume.

AMI is a blueprint for EC2 instance

## AWS Backup
Backup allows to consolidate your backup across multiple AWS services (EC2, EBS, EFS, ...)

AWS Backup with Org: backup mulitple accounts in your Org

Benefits of Backup: 
- Central Mgmt
- Automation
- Improve Compliance
